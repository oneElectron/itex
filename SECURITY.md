# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you find a vulnerability in ITex please send me an email at one.electron109@protonmail.com with the gpg key located at keyserver.ubuntu.com: b1a876c5cb13a348c46c84aae7184b3a26e0b253

## Vesions
Currently only the latest version will be updated with security updates.
This is because users are excpected to use the latest version anyway.
This could change in the future, I am flexible.
