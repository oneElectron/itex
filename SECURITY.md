# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.

## Vesions
Currently only the latest version will be updated with security updates.
This is because users are excpected to use the latest version anyway.
This could change in the future, I am flexible.
