   abstract = {This article presents a several-step method for estimating selected aerodynamic parameters and characteristics of an aircraft. The proposed method is based on the analysis of the CFD simulation results of the aircraft model on the example of the Airbus A380. The first stage of the research concerns the determination of aerodynamic force component values: lift force and drag under specific flight conditions, and determination of lift force coefficient and drag coefficient values. As part of the work, the comparison of the lift force coefficient values and drag coefficient depending on the angle of attack in order to determine its optimal value was made. The second stage of research concerns the estimation of the operational ceiling and the maximum ceiling of the Airbus A380 aircraft based on the standard atmosphere parameters and model simulation results for the optimal angle of attack. The proposed test method allows determining the height characteristics of aerodynamic force components depending on the speed of the aircraft flight, and can be used as a method of supporting the design stage of aircraft constructions.},
